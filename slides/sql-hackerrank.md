## üåç Average Population of Each Continent

**Problem**:  
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/average-population-of-each-continent/problem

**Description**:  
Query the names of all continents and their average city populations (rounded down). Use `FLOOR()` and join `CITY` with `COUNTRY`.

```sql
SELECT co.continent,  
       FLOOR(AVG(c.population)) AS average_population
FROM city c
JOIN country co ON c.countrycode = co.code
GROUP BY co.continent;
```

‚úÖ *Accurately joins and groups data to calculate the average population per continent.*

---

## üèÜ Contest Leaderboard

**Problem**:  https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/contest-leaderboard/problem

**Description**:  
Calculate each hacker‚Äôs total score by summing their maximum scores for each challenge. Exclude hackers with 0 score.

```sql
SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(max_score) AS total_score
FROM Hackers h
JOIN (
    SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS max_score
    FROM Submissions
    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id
) s ON h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, h.hacker_id;
```

‚úÖ *Finds each hacker‚Äôs best submission per challenge and sums them.*

---

#### üõ†Ô∏è Query Breakdown

- Get MAX(score) per hacker/challenge.
- JOIN with Hackers.
- GROUP BY hacker.
- Filter zero scores with `HAVING`.
- Order by score descending, hacker_id ascending.

## üî¢ Prime Numbers (MySQL 5.7)

**Problem**:  
Generate all prime numbers from 2 to 1000, concatenated using `&`.

**Description**:  
Use user-defined variables and `NOT EXISTS` to simulate logic for checking primality.

---

```sql
SET @row := 0;
SET @i := 0;

SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(prime_numbers.n ORDER BY prime_numbers.n SEPARATOR '&') AS prime_numbers
FROM (
    SELECT candidate_numbers.N AS n
    FROM (
        SELECT @row := @row + 1 AS N
        FROM information_schema.tables t1
        CROSS JOIN information_schema.tables t2
        LIMIT 1000
    ) candidate_numbers
    WHERE candidate_numbers.N > 1
      AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM (
            SELECT @i := @i + 1 AS num
            FROM information_schema.tables
            LIMIT 1000
        ) AS numbers
        WHERE numbers.num < candidate_numbers.N
          AND MOD(candidate_numbers.N, numbers.num) = 0
    )
) AS prime_numbers;
```

‚úÖ *Simulates loop with SQL logic for prime generation.*

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Breakdown

- `@row := @row + 1`: Simulates a **counter** to generate numbers 1 to 1000.
- `CROSS JOIN information_schema.tables t2`: Creates a **huge virtual table** to simulate looping behavior.
- **Subquery 1 (candidate_numbers)**:
  - Generates candidate numbers from 1 to 1000 using the simulated loop.
- **Subquery 2 (numbers)**:
  - For each candidate, checks for all numbers less than it that could divide it.
- `NOT EXISTS (...)`: If any number divides the candidate ‚Üí it's **not prime**, so exclude it.
- `GROUP_CONCAT`: Combines all valid primes into a single string, separated by `&`.

---


## üî¢ Print Prime Numbers (MySQL 8+)

**Problem**: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/print-prime-numbers/problem

**Description**:  <AutoFitText :max="15" :min="10" modelValue="Use recursive CTEs to generate prime numbers up to 1000 in one SQL statement."/>
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 2 AS n UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 1000
),divisors AS (
    SELECT 2 AS d UNION ALL
    SELECT d + 1 FROM divisors WHERE d < 500
)
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(n ORDER BY n SEPARATOR '&') AS result
FROM (
    SELECT n FROM numbers
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM divisors WHERE d < n AND n % d = 0
    )
) AS primes;
```
üí° *Elegant and fast solution using recursive CTE.*

    SELECT @row := @row - 1 AS n
    FROM (SELECT 0 UNION SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 2 UNION SELECT 3 UNION SELECT 4 
          UNION SELECT 5 UNION SELECT 6 UNION SELECT 7 UNION SELECT 8 UNION SELECT 9) a,
         (SELECT 0 UNION SELECT 1) b,
         (SELECT @row := 21) init
    LIMIT 20
) AS numbers
ORDER BY 1;
```
